"""agent/gateway.py — YOUR control plane. CONTRACTS.md section 4, exactly.

READ agent/README.md FIRST — it maps all five files in this directory to what
each is scored on. This file is the one CONTRACTS.md calls "the trusted
envelope's untrusted half": every single MCP / A2A / DISCOVER command your
agent's model wants to make passes through `Gateway.decide` before it is
allowed to happen.

WHY THERE IS NO `execute()` METHOD ON `GatewayContext` (read this before you
go looking for one — there isn't one, and that is not an oversight)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
CONTRACTS.md section 4's trusted envelope, reproduced here because it is the
one diagram worth memorising:

    [ trusted ]   loop emits a raw action line
         v
    [ trusted ]   INTERCEPT + CANONICALISE -> Command        (kit/loop/agent.py)
         v
    [ UNTRUSTED ] Gateway.decide(cmd) -> Decision             <- THIS FILE
         v
    [ trusted ]   ENFORCE: honour the Decision, meter it,
                  apply the active mutation, execute the
                  ToolCall or refuse it                       (the arena)
         v
    [ trusted ]   RECORD the authoritative L1 event, then
                  RENDER the Observation                      (the arena)
         v
    [ trusted ]   the model sees the Observation

`decide()` returns a *decision*, never a *result*. You cannot reach a tool
server, a file, a socket, or a clock from in here — there is nothing to
call. Two things follow from that, and both matter more than they look:

  1. YOUR TRACE CANNOT BE FORGED. Every `command` / `decision` / `enforced`
     / `tool_call` / `tool_result` L1 event (CONTRACTS.md 5.2) is written by
     the arena, from what the arena itself actually did — never from
     anything you claimed happened. A student gateway that wanted to lie
     about having blocked an attack ("I totally denied that, trust me")
     simply has no channel to lie through: the only thing you ever hand
     back is this one small `Decision` value, and the arena is the one that
     turns it into history.
  2. NOBODY CAN ACCUSE YOU OF A CALL YOU DID NOT AUTHORISE, either. Because
     `decide()` is the ONLY door a command can walk through on its way to
     actually running, a prosecutor's `enforcement_failure` claim against
     you has exactly one thing to point at: the `Decision` you returned for
     that specific `cmd_id`. There is no ambiguity about "maybe the loop
     called the tool directly" — CONTRACTS.md 4.2 removed that path on
     purpose, and kit/loop/agent.py's own module docstring names the same
     invariant from the other side (the loop never imports this module,
     never sees a `Decision`, never executes anything itself).

The cost of that guarantee is that this file is PURE: synchronous, no I/O,
no threads, no `sleep`, 250 ms wall-clock deadline (RULES.md section 3).
Raising anything, returning something that is not a valid `Decision`, or
missing the deadline is treated by the arena as a DENIED command PLUS a 2
credit penalty PLUS an `integrity` event that hands the prosecutor a free
`enforcement_failure` — CONTRACTS.md 4.1's charging table, reproduced in
agent/README.md's own table. Getting this file to just plainly return valid
`Decision` values, every time, is worth more than getting it clever.

THE STARTER'S SHAPE (read this before you start editing `decide()`)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This starter FORWARDS ALMOST EVERYTHING AND DENIES NOTHING. That is not a
placeholder oversight — it is the honest zero-defence baseline you are
meant to beat: `bots/rookie` in the kit's own ladder does exactly the same
thing, and RULES.md's own words are "if you cannot beat Rookie you have a
bug, not a strategy." `decide()` below is structured as four named jobs —
ROUTE, ADMIT, AUTHORIZE, BUDGET — each with a one-line TODO naming what a
real implementation checks and why. None of the four currently rejects,
rewrites, or reroutes anything; they are seams, not solutions. Fill them in
using `agent/strategy.py` (routing/budget policy) and `agent/guardrails.py`
(the safety checks) — both already import cleanly from here.

ONE THING WORTH INTERNALISING BEFORE YOU WRITE YOUR FIRST REAL CHECK:
`verdict="deny"` costs the CALLER (your own team) **zero credits** —
CONTRACTS.md 4.1's charging table has exactly one $0 row, and it is this
one. Refusing to make a call you cannot justify is FREE. That makes
abstention a real strategy, not a luxury you can't afford: a `deny` you can
defend beats a `forward` you can't, every time a prosecutor is watching.

Stdlib only. No network, no randomness, no wall-clock reads, no sleeping —
none of that would even survive the kernel sandbox (CONTRACTS.md 12), but
the point is this file has no reason to want any of it in the first place.

    arena owns and updates as the duel actually progresses (credits get
    spent, rounds advance, leases mint and expire), not a frozen snapshot
    you receive once. This file therefore models it as a structural
    `Protocol`: the arena hands your `Gateway.__init__` some object shaped
